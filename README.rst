Flavour for PHP - Getting started
=================================

This is a minimal project to explain how to use flavour with PHP. It contains a `app.flavour` file that is the basis for your project.
Flavour for PHP uses composer in the background, and will automatically manage addons which will be installed to your `app.flavour` and `composer.json` file.

_You will need **flavour-cli** to be installed_

No files are needed to make flavour work in your PHP project. Just execute your flavour commands in your project root and it will automatically create or adjust all configuration files.

The `samples` folder contains some sample yaml files that show possible options if you intend to build your own packages or registry or install from a different source.
